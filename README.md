# Generator-Gift-Nitro-and-Checker-Bot-Discord

The bot was reworked by me.
The Discord bot is written in Python.

To make it work, edit the code, paste your token. And complete the proxy list if you don't want to manually edit each IP address in the format, for example "http://167.172.109.12:41491/",
Then use GPT chat for that.
Finding a gift is very difficult or even impossible, which is why there are few such gifts, and each gift has as many as 16 characters

After writing the /dc command, when he finds a gift, he will send it to pv, if after a long time he will crash the bot.
